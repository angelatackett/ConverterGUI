# ConverterGUI
 
  * GUIConverter is a graphical user interface program that allows users to
 * convert distance from miles to kilometers and temperature from Fahrenheit to
 * Celsius. The program includes a main window with three buttons: Distance
 * Converter, Temperature Converter, and Exit. When the Distance Converter
 * button is clicked, a dialog box prompts the user to enter a distance in
 * miles. If the input is valid, the program converts the distance to
 * kilometers using the DistanceConverter class and displays the result in a
 * message dialog. When the Temperature Converter button is clicked, a dialog
 * box prompts the user to enter a temperature in Fahrenheit. If the input is
 * valid, the program converts the temperature to Celsius using the
 * TemperatureConverter class and displays the result in a message dialog. When
 * the Exit button is clicked, the program terminates. The program uses the
 * Converter class as a superclass for DistanceConverter and TemperatureConverter,
 * which provide specific conversion methods for distance and temperature
 * respectively. The program also includes private inner classes for the
 * ActionListeners of the three buttons, which handle user input and conversion
 * logic.
